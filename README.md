# README
This is an attempt to go through the fast.ai course but using PyTorch instead of fastai (which is the primary software used to teach the course). 
The primary goal of making this repo is to have all my learnings and experiments stored in one place.

The only reason I am using PyTorch instead of fastai itself is simply because my aim right now is to learn that specific framework while also learning to build cool stuff.
